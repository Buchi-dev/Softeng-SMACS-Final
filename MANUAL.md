## 1. ÔøΩÔøΩ Introduction
SMACS (Smart Management and Attendance Control System) is a comprehensive, web-based platform designed specifically for educational institutions to automate and streamline the process of attendance tracking. The system leverages RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology, allowing students and staff to check in at events and institutional programs by simply tapping their RFID-enabled ID cards on a reader. This eliminates manual attendance taking, reduces errors, and provides real-time data for administrators and organizers. SMACS is built to support a wide range of events, from daily classes to large seminars, and is scalable to accommodate institutions of varying sizes. The system also includes robust reporting, user management, and security features to ensure data integrity and privacy.

## 2. üñ•Ô∏è System Overview
The SMACS system is composed of both hardware and software components, working together to provide a seamless attendance tracking experience.

- **Hardware:**
  - RFID-enabled ID cards are issued to all students and staff. Each card contains a unique RFID tag that identifies the user.
  - RFID readers are installed at event venues or entry points. These readers can be connected via USB or serial ports to a computer running the SMACS client interface.
- **Software:**
  - The web-based dashboard is accessible to users with appropriate permissions (Admins and Organizers). It provides real-time monitoring, event management, and reporting tools.
  - The backend database is built on MongoDB, a NoSQL database that allows for flexible and scalable storage of user, event, and attendance data.
- **Database:**
  - MongoDB is chosen for its ability to handle large volumes of data and its flexibility in storing complex relationships between users, events, and attendance records.
- **Use Case:**
  - The primary use case is to log attendance for students and staff during events, seminars, and institutional programs. The system can also be adapted for regular class attendance, faculty meetings, and other scenarios where accurate attendance tracking is required.

## 4. üë• User Roles & Permissions
SMACS implements a role-based access control (RBAC) system to ensure that users only have access to the features and data relevant to their responsibilities. The main roles are:

| Role         | Access Level                                                      |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Admin**       | Full control over the system. Admins can manage all users, create and edit events, generate and download reports, configure system settings, and assign roles to other users. They are responsible for maintaining the integrity and security of the system.       |
| **Organizer**   | Organizers are typically faculty or staff members responsible for managing specific events. They can create and monitor events, view attendance records, and download reports related to their events. Organizers do not have access to system-wide settings or user management outside their scope.       |
| **Student/Staff** | The primary function for students and staff is to check in to events using their RFID-enabled ID cards. In future versions, they may also be able to view their personal attendance history through a self-service portal. |

Role assignment is managed by Admins through the dashboard, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive features.

## 7. üìç Attendance Tracking Workflow
This section explains the step-by-step process of how attendance is tracked using SMACS, from the moment a user enters the venue to the final logging of attendance data.

1. **User enters venue:** The student or staff member arrives at the event location where an RFID reader is installed.
2. **Scans RFID card:** The user taps their RFID-enabled ID card on the reader. The reader captures the card's unique identifier.
3. **Signal sent to server:** The RFID reader, connected to a computer running the SMACS client, sends the scan data to the server via the web interface.
4. **Database logging:** The server receives the scan, verifies the user and event, and logs the check-in time, event ID, and user ID in the MongoDB database.
5. **Dashboard update:** The dashboard updates in real-time, reflecting the user's attendance status for the event.

**Offline Mode:** If the internet connection is lost, the SMACS client caches scan data locally. Once the connection is restored, cached data is automatically synced with the server, ensuring no attendance records are lost.
